/* --- Make a Person

Fill in the object constructor with the following methods below:

getFirstName()
getLastName()
getFullName()
setFirstName(first)
setLastName(last)
setFullName(firstAndLast)
Run the tests to see the expected output for each method.

The methods that take an argument must accept only one argument and it has to be a string.

These methods must be the only available means of interacting with the object.

Remember to use Read-Search-Ask if you get stuck. Try to pair program. Write your own code.

var Person = function(firstAndLast) {
    return firstAndLast;
};

var bob = new Person('Bob Ross');
bob.getFullName();

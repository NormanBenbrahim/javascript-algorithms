# JavaScript Algorithm Challenges

This is the repo where I will keep my solutions to the JavaScript algorithm challenges posted on [FreeCodeCamp](www.freecodecamp.com). 

I started this repo when I got to the intermediate algorithm challenges, since I felt that at this point the difficulty picked up significantly. 

You will find a description of the problem within each of the files. The solutions are all in javascript.

EDIT: As of April 18th 2016 I have completed these challenges! :D

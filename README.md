# JavaScript Algorithm Challenges

This is the repo where I will keep my solutions to the JavaScript algorithm challenges posted on [FreeCodeCamp](www.freecodecamp.com). 

I started this repo when I got to the intermediate algorithm challenges, since I felt that at this point the difficulty picked up significantly. 

The solutions are all in javascript.
